# Interactive Shopping List README

## Overview

This project is an interactive shopping list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage a shopping list by adding items, marking them as purchased, and clearing the list.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a functional web application where users can perform the following actions:
- Add new items to the shopping list.
- Mark items as purchased by clicking on them, visually indicating their completion status.
- Clear the entire shopping list.

## Features Implemented

1. **Add Item:**
   - Users can enter an item into the input field provided and either click the "Add" button or press Enter to add it to the list.
   
2. **Mark as Purchased:**
   - Clicking on an item toggles its completion status. Completed items are visually indicated with a strike-through text style.
   
3. **Clear List:**
   - Clicking the "Clear List" button removes all items from the shopping list.

## Technical Details

- **HTML Structure:** Defines the layout of the webpage, including forms, input fields, lists, and buttons.
  
- **CSS Styling:** Provides visual styling for elements to improve usability and aesthetics.
  
- **JavaScript Logic:** Manages the core functionality of the application, including handling user actions (adding, marking, clearing items) and updating the DOM dynamically.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Manipulating arrays and DOM elements using JavaScript.
- Implementing event-driven programming to create interactive user interfaces.
- Applying fundamental HTML structure and CSS styling principles to enhance web page design.

## Future Improvements

For future iterations of this project, I plan to:
- Implement editing functionality for existing items.
- Explore local storage to persist the shopping list data.
